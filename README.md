### Summarize

```
Task is to build an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer.
```

### What did you do particularly well?

```
I did a great job as a programmer. I did create greate code work and all my functions have no error because I have updated my code when I found the possibility of a bug.
```

### Where could you enhance your code?

```
I would like to put some UI system for my code which is called frontend-server like Next.js or Vue.js so my app is easy to be used for a user.
```

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

```
File read and create functions was most hard part for me. To be honest, C++ is not my best option to code. I am not familiar with it so it was hard to find out how to use it. However, as a programmer, research and ability of find the way to solve are one of most important skill so I tried hard to improve my C++ skill. zyBooks was helpful and google search was big part as well.
```

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

```
I think C++ is a server side language so I can use this experience to other server developing project.
```

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

```
As I said above, I think if I put the frontend server on it. I can use this code as my backend server. Then, I can keep upgrade it to provide good item tracking service to a user.
